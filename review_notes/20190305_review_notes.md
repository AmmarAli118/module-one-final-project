# Notes

## What Works:
1.

## What Doesn't
1. Manually generate playlist
2. Stats for individual songs
3. Delete Playlists
4. Changing song order

## Recommendations
1. Generate Playlist:
  - order tags by opposites (happy/melancholy)
2. Playlist Viewer
  - only include songs with option to view stats in a separate window
  - place commands at bottom so they are more visible
  - reorder playlist
3. Playlist Stats
  - remove instrumentalness/ liveness / speechiness
